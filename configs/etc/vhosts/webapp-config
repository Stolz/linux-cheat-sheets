# USER-EDITABLE SETTINGS

# Feel free to edit these settings to suit your local needs
#
# ========================================================================

# vhost_root is the directory where virtual host websites are added
# so, if your server is hosting (say)
#
#   www.gentoo.org
#   bugs.gentoo.org
#
# then the htdocs directory for each of these would be
#
#   /var/www/www.gentoo.org/htdocs
#   /var/www/bugs.gentoo.org/htdocs
#
# Change this setting *only* if you need your websites installed in
# a different physical location
#
# If you prefer to use Gentoo's optional support for the /srv service
# home file hierarchy, uncomment the second version of vhost_root
# (this should have been done for you if you installed webapp-config
# with the srvdir USE flag enabled)
# If you want to have fine grained control over the location the web
# applications get installed, you can use the third setting

vhost_root="/var/www/${vhost_hostname}"
#vhost_root="/srv/${vhost_hostname}/www"
#vhost_root="/var/www/${vhost_subdomain_1}/${vhost_subdomain_2}/${vhost_subdomain_3}"

# some web applications need to know what host they are serving up pages
# for.  this information is configured when the application is installed
# by the webapp-config script
#
# changing this value *after* the application has been installed has
# no effect!!
#
# you can override this setting by using the -h switch to webapp-config
#
# IMPORTANT: If you comment this setting and provide no explicit hostname
# with the command line -h switch, webapp-config will try to determine
# the fully qualified domain name by itself

vhost_hostname="localhost"

# what web server are you using?
# your choices are:
#
# apache
# lighttpd
# cherokee
# nginx
# gatling
# tracd
# uwsgi

#
# you can override this setting by using the -s switch to webapp-config

vhost_server="nginx"

# which user should own config files?
# the default is the user currently running webapp-config (which is
# normally the root user). You may either use the numerical uid or the
# user name. The internal default is "0" to accomodate for BSD style
# systems.
#
# you can override this setting by using the -u switch to webapp-config

#vhost_config_uid="root"

# which group should own config files?
# the default is the group of the user currently running webapp-config
# (which is normally the root group). You may either use the numerical
# gid or the group name. The internal default is "0" to accomodate for
# BSD style systems.
#
# you can override this setting by using the -g switch to webapp-config

#vhost_config_gid="root"

# what type of shared directories should be created?
# the default is 'default-owned', which means that each install of the app
# gets a copy of the directory
#
# permitted values are: server-owned, config-owned, default-owned
#
# you can override this setting by using the --default-dirs switch to
# webapp-config

vhost_config_default_dirs="default-owned"

# what type of shared files should be created?
# the default is 'virtual', which means that each install of the app
# does NOT get a unique copy of the files
#
# permitted values are: server-owned, config-owned, virtual
#
# you can override this setting by using the --virtual-files switch to
# webapp-config

vhost_config_virtual_files="virtual"

# where should drop-in config files for webservers go?
#
# these files will be called <server>-<app>.conf.  They are quite rare,
# but are needed from time to time by the odd application or two

vhost_config_dir="${vhost_root}/conf"

# which user & group should own the files by default?
#
# the default is for files to be owned by the superuser root, so that
# they cannot be tampered with by other users
#
# this setting affects the files and directories installed by the ebuild,
# and it affects some directories created by webapp-config.  It does not
# affect any of the files installed by webapp-config at this time.

vhost_default_uid="root"
vhost_default_gid="root"

# what type of links do you want to use?
#
# starting with webapp-config v1.10, the default behaviour is to attempt
# to hardlink a file from /usr/share/webapps/* first.  If the hardlink
# fails (normally because /usr and /var | /srv are on different filesystems)
# webapp-config will fall back to making a physical copy of the file
# instead
#
# NOTE:
#   we have moved to hardlinks because not all web-based packages work
#   when their files are symlinked in
#
#   please do not raise bugs about packages that do not work when
#   symlinked
#
# vhost_link_type="soft"

# what are the names of your document directories?
#
# by default, your website lives in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs.  If you
# run webapp-config with the --secure switch, your website instead lives
# in /var/www/<hostname>/htdocs-secure.
#
# you can change the default names of 'htdocs' and 'htdocs-secure' by
# editing these two variables

vhost_htdocs_insecure="htdocs"
vhost_htdocs_secure="htdocs-secure"

# what permissions do you want the files to have?
#
# by default, webapp-config installs directories and files with these
# permissions.  You can change them here to comply with your local
# security policies.
# You need to specify octal values ("0nnn") or you can use the encoding
# used by chmod ("[ugoa]{1,3}[+-=]{rwx]{1,3}" elements as a comma
# seperated list)

vhost_perms_serverowned_dir="0775"
vhost_perms_serverowned_file="0664"

vhost_perms_configowned_dir="0755"
vhost_perms_configowned_file="0644"

vhost_perms_defaultowned_dir="0755"
vhost_perms_virtualowned_file="o-w"

vhost_perms_installdir="0755"

# Allow specifying absolute path names using the -d option?
allow_absolute="no"

# Supported package managers: portage, paludis
package_manager="portage"

# EDIT THE VARIABLES BELOW THIS LINE AT YOUR OWN RISK
#
# These variables are used by the webapp.eclass component of Portage,
# and by /usr/sbin/webapp-config.
#
# If you break your Gentoo installation by changing these settings, then
# re-emerge the webapps-config package to restore the default values
#
# When webapp-config is upgraded, it may add to and/or change the value of
# variables listed here.  If you do not merge in these changes, you will
# probably find that webapp-config will break in horrible ways.
#
# etc-update is NOT optional ;-)
#
# ========================================================================

# which version of webapp-config is this file for?
#
# we have a problem when users upgrade webapp-config.  It turns out that
# they don't explicitly upgrade webapp-config ... instead, webapp-config
# gets because it is a dependency for a web-based package.
#
# unfortunately, this means that any changes to this config file do not
# get installed (through etc-update or equivalent) until after the web-
# based package has been installed.  We end up trying to install the
# package using a partial install of webapp-config
#
# how can we work around this?
#
# the only way to work around this is to put some sort of version-control
# marker in this config file.  webapp-config and this file must agree on
# what this marker is, otherwise webapp-config will refuse to work

WA_CONF_VERSION="7"
