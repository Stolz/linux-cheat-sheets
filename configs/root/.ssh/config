# SSH reads this file from top to bottom. Every time a matching host is found all its options are applied to the
# upcoming connection. Every new matching host section can ONLY define options that have NOT been already defined in previous
# matching host sections. If an option has already been given by a previously matched section it will be ignored.

# To see which options are being aplied to a host add the -G parameter to the connecion command
